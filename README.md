# Fact or Fake - Open Data Edition

A fun web game where players guess whether statements are true facts from open data sources or clever fakes generated by AI.

## Overview

Fact or Fake challenges players to distinguish between real data from open APIs and artificially modified facts. Each game consists of 10 rounds where players must identify whether a displayed statement is a genuine fact or a fabrication.

## Features

- **Real Open Data Integration**: Fetches live data from multiple open APIs
  - REST Countries API (population, capitals, areas)
  - Public APIs directory
  - Fallback scientific facts

- **Smart Fake Generation**: AI-powered system that creates believable fake facts by:
  - Modifying numbers by 30-70%
  - Swapping countries, cities, or other key terms
  - Maintaining realistic formatting

- **Engaging UI/UX**:
  - Minimalist, modern design
  - Smooth animations (fade-in, shake, glow effects)
  - Instant feedback after each answer
  - Detailed source information for learning

- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your performance across 10 rounds

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6
- **Styling**: Pure CSS with animations
- **Deployment**: Netlify-ready

## Game Mechanics

### Gameplay Loop

1. A statement is displayed (e.g., "France has a population of 68 million")
2. Player clicks either "Fact" or "Fake"
3. Instant feedback reveals the truth with:
   - Correct/incorrect indication
   - Source information
   - Real values and context
4. Score updates if correct
5. Next round begins automatically
6. After 10 rounds, final score and accuracy are shown

### Scoring

- **+1 point** for each correct guess
- **Maximum score**: 10/10 (100% accuracy)
- Performance messages based on accuracy:
  - 100%: "Perfect! You're a data expert!"
  - 80%+: "Excellent! Great job!"
  - 60%+: "Good work! Keep practicing!"
  - 40%+: "Not bad! Try again to improve!"
  - <40%: "Better luck next time!"

## APIs Used

- **REST Countries API** (`https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all`)
  - Population data
  - Capital cities
  - Country areas

- **Public APIs** (`https://api.publicapis.org/entries`)
  - Meta-information about available APIs
  - Categories and descriptions

## Deployment

The project is configured for easy deployment on Netlify:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. Netlify will automatically detect the build settings from `netlify.toml`
3. Build command: `npm run build`
4. Publish directory: `dist`

Alternatively, deploy manually:

```bash
npm run build
# Upload the 'dist' folder to your hosting service
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)
- Include more data sources (Wikipedia, World Bank, etc.)
- Multiplayer mode
- Leaderboard system
- Share results on social media
- More sophisticated fake generation algorithms
- Category selection (geography, science, demographics)
